The solution involves increasing the specificity of the `.container h1` selector or using `!important` to override the general `h1` style, though the latter is less preferable for maintainability. Here's a solution using increased specificity:

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
}

.container h1 {
  color: red !important; /* less preferrable solution */
}

.container {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

Alternatively, a more robust approach is to make your selectors more specific.  For example:

```css
.container {
  background-color: yellow;
}

.container h1 {
  color: red;
}

#container h1 { /*If container is a div with id container*/
    color: red;
}

h1 {
  color: blue;
}
```
This ensures that your desired styles are applied correctly without resorting to `!important`.
